Strong considerations

1. finish putting the csv's (5 statement types) from '2014-16'✅
2. write script that 
	-cleans and merges the data
	-gives basic EDA from each excel file by year
	( each year has a code block that draws insight from that year)
	- scan sheets ( balance, income, stockholders, etc) from each book(year)
